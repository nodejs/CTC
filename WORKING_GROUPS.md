# Node.js Core Working Groups

Node.js Core Working Groups are autonomous projects created by the
[Core Technical Committee (CTC)](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#core-technical-committee).

Working Groups can be formed at any time but must be ratified by the CTC.
Once formed the work defined in the Working Group charter is the
responsibility of the WG rather than the CTC.

It is important that Working Groups are not formed pre-maturely. Working
Groups are not formed to *begin* a set of tasks but instead are formed
once that work is already underway and the contributors
think it would benefit from being done as an autonomous project.

If the work defined in a Working Group's charter is complete, the charter
should be revoked.

A Working Group's charter can be revoked either by consensus of the Working
Group's members or by a CTC vote. Once revoked, any future work that arises
becomes the responsibility of the CTC.

## Joining a WG

To find out how to join a working group, consult the GOVERNANCE.md in
the working group's repository, or in the working group's repository.

## Starting A Core Working Group

The process to start a Core Working Group is identical to [creating a 
Top Level Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/WORKING_GROUPS.md#starting-a-wg).

### [Website](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org)

The website Working Group's purpose is to build and maintain a public
website for the Node.js project.

Responsibilities include:
* Developing and maintaining a build and automation system for nodejs.org.
* Ensuring the site is regularly updated with changes made to Node.js, like
  releases and features.
* Fostering and enabling a community of translators.

### [Streams](https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream)

The Streams Working Group is dedicated to the support and improvement of the
Streams API as used in Node.js and the npm ecosystem. We seek to create a
composable API that solves the problem of representing multiple occurrences
of an event over time in a humane, low-overhead fashion. Improvements to the
API will be driven by the needs of the ecosystem; interoperability and
backwards compatibility with other solutions and prior versions are paramount
in importance.

Responsibilities include:
* Addressing stream issues on the Node.js issue tracker.
* Authoring and editing stream documentation within the Node.js project.
* Reviewing changes to stream subclasses within the Node.js project.
* Redirecting changes to streams from the Node.js project to this project.
* Assisting in the implementation of stream providers within Node.js.
* Recommending versions of `readable-stream` to be included in Node.js.
* Messaging about the future of streams to give the community advance notice of
  changes.

### [Build](https://github.com/nodejs/build)

The Build Working Group's purpose is to create and maintain a distributed
automation infrastructure.

Responsibilities include:
* Producing packages for all target platforms.
* Running tests.
* Running performance testing and comparisons.
* Creating and managing build-containers.

### [Diagnostics](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics)

The Diagnostics Working Group's purpose is to surface a set of comprehensive,
documented, and extensible diagnostic interfaces for use by Node.js tools and
JavaScript VMs.

Responsibilities include:
* Collaborating with V8 to integrate `v8_inspector` into Node.js.
* Collaborating with V8 to integrate `trace_event` into Node.js.
* Collaborating with Core to refine `async_wrap` and `async_hooks`.
* Maintaining and improving OS trace system integration (e.g. ETW, LTTNG, dtrace).
* Documenting diagnostic capabilities and APIs in Node.js and its components.
* Exploring opportunities and gaps, discussing feature requests, and addressing
  conflicts in Node.js diagnostics.
* Fostering an ecosystem of diagnostics tools for Node.js.

### i18n

The i18n Working Groups handle more than just translations. They
are endpoints for community members to collaborate with each
other in their language of choice.

Each team is organized around a common spoken language. Each
language community might then produce multiple localizations for
various project resources.

Responsibilities include:
* Translating any Node.js materials they believe are relevant to their
  community.
* Reviewing processes for keeping translations up to date and of high quality.
* Managing and monitoring social media channels in their language.
* Promoting Node.js speakers for meetups and conferences in their language.

Note that the i18n Working Groups are distinct from the [Intl](#Intl) Working Group.

Each language community maintains its own membership.

* Ensuring functionality & compliance (standards: ECMA, Unicode…)
* Supporting Globalization and Internationalization issues that come up
  in the tracker
* Communicating guidance and best practices
* Refining the existing `Intl` implementation

The Intl Working Group is not responsible for translation of content. That is the
responsibility of the specific [i18n](#i18n) group for each language.

### [Evangelism](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism)

* Keeping the official Docker images updated in line with new Node.js releases.
* Decide and implement image improvements and/or fixes.
* Maintain and improve the images' documentation.

### [Addon API](https://github.com/nodejs/nan)

The Addon API Working Group is responsible for maintaining the NAN project and
corresponding _nan_ package in npm. The NAN project makes available an
abstraction layer for native add-on authors for Node.js,
assisting in the writing of code that is compatible with many actively used
versions of Node.js, V8 and libuv.

Responsibilities include:
* Maintaining the [NAN](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) GitHub repository,
  including code, issues and documentation.
* Maintaining the [addon-examples](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples)
  GitHub repository, including code, issues and documentation.
* Maintaining the C++ Addon API within the Node.js project, in subordination to
  the Node.js CTC.
* Maintaining the Addon documentation within the Node.js project, in
  subordination to the Node.js CTC.
* Maintaining the _nan_ package in npm, releasing new versions as appropriate.
* Messaging about the future of the Node.js and NAN interface to give the
  community advance notice of changes.

The current members can be found in their
[README](https://github.com/nodejs/nan#collaborators).

### [Benchmarking](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking)

The purpose of the Benchmark Working Group is to gain consensus
on an agreed set of benchmarks that can be used to:

* track and evangelize performance gains made between Node.js releases
* avoid performance regressions between releases

Responsibilities include:
* Identifying 1 or more benchmarks that reflect customer usage.
  Likely will need more than one to cover typical Node.js use cases
  including low-latency and high concurrency
* Working to get community consensus on the list chosen
* Adding regular execution of chosen benchmarks to Node.js builds
* Tracking/publicizing performance between builds/releases

### [Post-mortem](https://github.com/nodejs/post-mortem)

The Post-mortem Diagnostics Working Group is dedicated to the support
and improvement of postmortem debugging for Node.js. It seeks to
elevate the role of postmortem debugging for Node, to assist in the
development of techniques and tools, and to make techniques and tools
known and available to Node.js users.

Responsibilities include:
* Defining and adding interfaces/APIs in order to allow dumps
  to be generated when needed.
* Defining and adding common structures to the dumps generated
  in order to support tools that want to introspect those dumps.

### [Documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/docs)

The Documentation Working Group exists to support the improvement of Node.js
documentation, both in the core API documentation, and elsewhere, such as the
Node.js website. Its intent is to work closely with the Evangelism, Website, and
Intl Working Groups to make excellent documentation available and accessible
to all.

Responsibilities include:
* Defining and maintaining documentation style and content standards.
* Producing documentation in a format acceptable for the Website Working Group
  to consume.
* Ensuring that Node's documentation addresses a wide variety of audiences.
* Creating and operating a process for documentation review that produces
  quality documentation and avoids impeding the progress of Core work.

### [Testing](https://github.com/nodejs/testing)

The Node.js Testing Working Group's purpose is to extend and improve testing of
the Node.js source code.

Responsibilities include:
* Coordinating an overall strategy for improving testing.
* Documenting guidelines around tests.
* Working with the Build Working Group to improve continuous integration.
* Improving tooling for testing.
