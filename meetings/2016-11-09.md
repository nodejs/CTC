## Minutes

### Roadmap WG status [#16](https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/16)

* CTC consensus that this does not need to be a formal WG. 
* Additional votes were added by those in attendance to the issue,
  we should now have enough LTGMs in the issue to consider approved.

### buffer: hard-deprecate calling Buffer without new
  (https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/8169)

* James, for near term, revert in 7 and revisit in 8.
* Chalker, still believe we should deprecate, gathering more
  information, 5-10% of modules are using in an unsafe way, some
  related to base64 encoding, could result in memory leaks or 
  Dos. Not related to new, need to deprecate both in next release.
  Want people to migrate to buffer.alloc.  
* Ben: can we address by zero fill by default for new ?
* Chalker: Problem is won.t be in place for old versions, module
  that runs on new/old will be at risk on old. We should add zero
  fill when we do hard deprecation.
* Evan: should have deprecated both so that people are not forced to 
  change twice.
* James: can.t deprecate constructor completely. Original idea was to 
  phase out new so that we could improve inheritance.
* Evan: reason not well communicated.
* James: communicated but complainers don.t see value .
* Chalker: deprecation is only way to help identify those modules at
  risk, zero fill only addresses one issue. Hard deprecation only way
  to make sure security vulnerability is addressed.
* Chalker: putting together list of packages that may be affected
* Myles: reach out to individuals who will be affected so that we can
  get more direct appreciation of their concerns ? 
* Jeremia, some commenters may be more ok with fix for security.
* Myles: need to get info on modules that will be affected 
  and talk to concerned people, also should consider zero fill
  even if older versions are not addressed.
* Ben: see also https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/7152?
* Anna: Discussion has fragmented across threads
* Trott: take back to github at this point ? 
* Myles: should we revert current warning since we are not converging ?
* NEXT STEPS: open 2 issues to continue discussion:
  * short term for revert (Anna)
  * longer term one for fuller discussion (Chalker ?)
