## Minutes

### A new New CTC Meeting Schedule Proposal [#29](https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/29)

@trott: Propose continuing with current 2 times in the meantime, discuss with
Ben and others how to improve in the future.

CTC repo (https://github.com/nodejs/ctc) has a list of upcoming meetings through
end of December: https://github.com/nodejs/ctc#meeting-schedule

@joshgav: William Kapke maintains a Google calendar:
<https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=kap.co_i17i575te0aes6kaanfjr2e4hs%40group.calendar.google.com>

---

### Documentation WG Status [#32](https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/32)

@trott: William Kapke asked that people chime in on this topic.

---

### Revert "buffer: runtime deprecation of calling Buffer without new" [#9529](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/9529)

@trott: To be moved to private discussion.

---

### tls: fix leak of WriteWrap+TLSWrap combination [#9626](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/9626)

@bnoordhius: I believe Fedor wants to expedite backporting this into v6.x and
v4.x.

@thealphanerd: I suggested getting it into v7.x first, then prepare for LTS.
Fedor and others approved on IRC, so no changes to release plans.

I staged that change in v7.x-staging and will coordinate with whoever does the
next v7.x release.

I’d prefer if we can get a v7.x release by next Tuesday (11/22) so that there
are two weeks for it to bake before it lands in LTS releases.

@Fishrock123: I’ll get a v7.x release out early next week.

Next steps:

* Fix in next v7.x release than backport.

### src: don't call into VM from AsyncWrap destructor [#9467](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/9467)

@bnoordhuis: Due to way V8 GC works code cannot call into VM during a GC.
async_hooks includes a `destroy` hook which runs when these objects are
garbage-collected. That’s never been safe, and is now causing crashes.

Stop-gap measure is to remove the `destroy` hook for now. If someone wants to
work on an alternative that would be welcome.

@mhdawson: Will removing it break stuff? Should we just have it do nothing (make
it a no-op)?

@trevnorris: Previously we had a lot of weak objects so that callers wouldn’t
crash if the object was GC’ed (?). That’s no longer necessary cause we have more
guards.

Several options to solve this issue:

Remove all weak handles completely.
Use second-pass GC callback.
Put `destroy` callbacks into a uv_idle_t and let callbacks be called in next
loop with `setImmediate`.

@Fishrock123: async_hooks is an “experimental” API, so technically it could be
removed or changed at any time. So we could remove that to make it not crash. Is
that a good idea? I’d prefer to make them no-ops instead.

@trevnorris: That (no-ops) would be more dangerous cause users might be
expecting it to run and rely on it to clean up stuff.

@Fishrock123: Well the alternative is that they’ll crash anyway.

@trevnorris: Many apps don’t crash and they’d be fine.

@bnoordhuis: Removing all weak handles would be a good option.

@trevnorris: Will work on that.

@trott: Do we have agreement?

@bnoordhuis: Question is time. If the better fix won’t be ready in 1-2 weeks I’d
still push for removing `destroy` hook for now.

@trevnorris: Will start on removing weak handles. If that’s not feasible to get
done before next release, will use the uv_idle_t approach and get done before
next release.

@Fishrock123: Does it only affect those using async_wrap?

@bnoordhuis: Yes, but some use async_wrap through second-level dependencies.

@trevnorris: Also affects users of `node-weak` module for the same reasons.

From YouTube: Should experimental features be kept out of releases?

@thealphanerd: This is how we test new features.

Next steps:

* @trevnorris implement steps above.
