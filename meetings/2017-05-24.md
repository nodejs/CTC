## Minutes

### http: overridable keep-alive behavior of `Agent` [node#13005](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/13005)

The PR does not seem to be contentious. Label ctc-review instead.

---

### Invert dependency between core and readable-stream [node-eps#49](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/pull/49)

@Trott: @mcollina cannot make this meeting. He indicates that this now targets Node.js 9. I propose deferring this to next week (or @mcollina can call for a vote in the issue).

@rvagg: I think this is a good idea. Streams is one thing that core has little expertise managing, and the Streams WG is the place for this. +1 Probably someone will need to call for a vote after Node.js 8.0.0 comes out.
