## Minutes

### Suggested change for Stand Up [CTC#119](https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/119)

Standup is useful for informing others of stuff, but not useful as a report on our own personal activities. Perhaps we should transform into a short open forum?

Previous meeting review is helpful to keep people informed. But perhaps we should list actions assigned instead?

---

### Bring string\_decoder into the foundation [readable-stream#272](https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream/issues/272)

@mcollina: As with readable-stream, string\_decoder is repackaged and included in Node.js; readable-stream uses it. It hasn't been updated in a while; most recent release was with Node v0.10.

string\_decoder is used by readable-stream, browserify, and webpack. Since it hasn't been updated and needs to be maintained, @rvagg agreed that we should bring it into the Foundation.

Copyright is the same as core.

Would be managed by the Streams WG.

@trott: Needs review by TSC too.

Should we invert dependency and include string\_decoder in /deps as proposed for readable-stream in [node-eps#49](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/pull/49)?
@mcollina: not much PR traffic so may not be worthwhile to have that overhead. I (Matteo) only noticed because someone filed an issue.

* Summary: Why bring string\_decoder into Foundation?

    * readable-stream needs it, readable-stream is in core
    * not easily maintainable where it is currently

Will need to manage permissions to package in npm. @mhdawson: Add the Foundation npm user to your package as a backup for if/when access is needed. Doc on this: <https://github.com/nodejs/build/pull/670>.

**Next steps**

* Matteo to open an issue for TSC approval.


### lib,src: eagerly exit process on unhanded promise rejections [node#12734](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/12734)

Handling promise rejections was discussed at Collaborators' Summit; options are:

1. Leave as currently is (print warning, no throw) for now.
2. Throw on next tick. This is not popular in ecosystem.
3. Throw on next garbage collection. Feedback is that this is too unpredictable and possibly too late.

Variation on (1) is to print a full stack trace with the warning.

@Fishrock123: --trace-warnings provides full stack trace with the warning. @jasnell: But it provides a stack of the warning rather than the unhandled rejection. @Fishrock123: That might be a bug?

@jasnell added a details field to the promise rejection warning. Could include stack trace for rejection itself in those details.

@Fishrock123: could that be controlled by --trace-warnings flag too?

@ChALkeR: Can we change Promise spec to require a synchronous catch for rejections rather than allowing an asynchronous rejection?
@Fishrock123: How would engine guarantee a synchronous handler is available?
@jasnell would like to discuss with TC39, will organize a group of Node.js stakeholders. Send James an email with suggested participants.

**Next steps**

* James to form a group of stakeholders to propose a solution.


### inspector: restore --debug-brk alias [node#12580](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/12580)

Current consensus is to add back --debug-brk as an alias to --inspect-brk, but keep --inspect-brk too.

@Fishrock123: Why was --debug-brk removed? A: Actually it was only removed in master, hasn't landed in a 7.x release. So adding back --debug-brk to master now will resolve problems for 8.0.0.

@ofrobots: Very little cost to add --debug-brk back as an alias, and given so much existing documentation, makes sense to add back in.

@jasnell: Makes sense, adding back as alias is cheap.

@trott: Ben and Jeremiah have objections, need to address them or call for a vote.

@Fishrock123: Why is --debug-brk needed in a later version? A: For consistency for debugging tools.

@joshgav: Change to remove --debug-brk will happen at a version boundary (8.0.0) so can version detection logic just differentiate between 7.x and 8.x?

@jasnell: Would be best to have --debug\* flags as aliases for now (8.0.0), could print a deprecation message asking to use --inspect\*.

Proposal: Restore --debug-brk as an alias that also prints deprecation warnings.

@ChALkeR: but actual behavior of --debug-brk will have changed, so we should just print a message and exit.

@jasnell: In that case should be an error.

@ChALkeR: Will investigate if alias would break anything.

**Next steps**

* Никита to review use as alias for potential problems.
* If/when Никита approves: restore --debug-brk as an alias to --inspect-brk that also prints a deprecation warning.

---

### Upgrade openssl-1.1.0e for Node-v8 (DO NOT LAND THIS) [node#11828](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11828)

@mhdawson to review with @sam-github to determine next steps.

---

### Invert dependency between core and readable-stream [node-eps#49](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/pull/49)

Out of time and this won't ship in 8.0.0, so postpone discussion.

---

### Update on 8.0.0

@jasnell: Significant perf regression with EventEmitter and streams, perhaps related to V8 changes, James and V8 team are investigating.

@mcollina: Crankshaft added an unoptimized path for Array.shift, need to backport fix from later V8 versions.

@mhdawson: Should we add RC's to benchmarks? A: Yes.

@jasnell: Preparing a Release Candidate today, but still might be more breaking changes. Please test!

* PR for npm@5 opened (<https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/12936>). Current plan is to include if it's stable.

## Q&A, Other

* Q: How to contribute to Node.js?

	* http://nodetodo.org.
	* Code and Learn events, there will be one in Shanghai this summer as part of JSConf China.

* Take a look at WG charter recommendations from James.

* Seeking review and feedback on <https://github.com/Microsoft/node-diagnostic-channel>, a proposal and implementation for sharing module patches and perhaps eventually not needing them.
