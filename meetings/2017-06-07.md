## Minutes
 
### doc: note that EoL platforms are not supported [#12672](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/12672)
 
@mhdawson: suggestion to add to support policy that platforms are no longer supported once they reach end-of-life, even if Node.js hasn't changed versions.
 
Question is what does support mean to begin with - is it just "best effort"? And what does it mean that it changes if the platform isn't supported?
 
@mylesborins: A good example is Node 6 and Ubuntu 12.04. That version of Ubuntu isn't supported by Canonical, should we continue to support Node 6 on it?
 
@mhdawson: If we tell people from the beginning of the semver-major that support for unsupported platforms will cease even within semver-major cycle, that would be okay.
 
@mhdawson: Recommended this text: "Community doesn't build and test against EOL distributions..."
 
@trott: Agree with @ljharb but defer to LTS/Build working groups. Why? Because we supported the distribution at the beginning of the LTS. *Supported* means we'll try.
 
@rvagg: We've had increasing difficulty getting needed images from our cloud providers for some distributions which aren't supported, like CentOS 5.
 
@mhdawson: So question is how strongly to state the change when a distro goes EOL.
 
@mylesborins: Makes sense to orient around what we test. @trott: Agree.
 
@rvagg: We'd need to list the platforms we do test on. We don't test on Arch, RHEL (assume CentOS covers it).
 
@mhdawson: we don't list tested platforms and it indeed may not make it completely clear, but it would serve as an advisory.
 
@joshgav: support implies "we will fix it" at Microsoft and is different than "best effort". @mhdawson: open source by nature is "best effort", perhaps we shouldn't use the term "support"? @joshgav: that makes sense, but may worry enterprises using Node. It's tricky.
 
@trott: Recommend taking back to GitHub with these suggestions and finalizing there.
 
@rvagg: in practice we support libc and compiler (e.g. gcc) versions. As long as supported versions of those are on the target system it should work. So we may never run into problems here as long as we're supporting that rough environment.
 
@mylesborins: any objections to dropping EOL OS's from CI? @rvagg: Binaries for later versions are sometimes built on earlier versions, e.g. CentOS 5 for Node < 8.
 
@mhdawson: supported kernel levels don't change for a semver-major release.
 
@mylesborins: maybe we should deliberately choose kernel/libc/gcc versions before we go LTS.
 
@mhdawson: we did this for 4 for AIX.
 
@matteo: We should proactively determine this prior to going LTS. For example, if we know Ubuntu 12.04 will go out of support we can state that it will go away from Node too from the start of LTS.
 
@trott: back to GitHub? And cc in appropriate groups.

**Next steps**

* Back to GitHub.
